Exercise 1-1. Write a simple game guess the number.
The program will randomly choose a number within the specified range and will wait for the user to input a number.
If the number is smaller or greater than that chosen by the program, the system tells that to the user.
If the guessed number is correct, then the game is over and the program displays the number of iterations taken.

Exercise 1-2. Write a recursive function that computes factorial

Exercise 1-3. Write a function computing the average from arbitrary numbers of an argument.

Exercise 1-4. Write a function adding two numbers in the following manner: add(1)(2) == 3

Exercise 1-5. Write a decorator that computes the execution time of the decorated function

Exercise 1-6. Write a function that computes a large factorial using multiple threads using function from 1-2
